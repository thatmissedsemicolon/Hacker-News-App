## Project Name
Python Server - A News Web Application

## Description

A news web application developed with Python using Flask, a web framework for Python. It boasts a sleek user interface styled with HTML & Tailwind CSS. It's hosted on a Linode server and managed with Gunicorn, a Python WSGI server. The application is further optimized with Nginx for handling client requests efficiently.

One of the core features of this project is to integrate the Hacker News API. This allows our users to view the latest news and intereact with news for example like and dislike the news in a user-friendly interface. User authentication is managed through Auth0, providing a secure and seamless login experience.

Admin view has ability to view all the news items, see which user interacted with the news, view related keywords from the title, ability to delete the news and the reactions from the news, edit the news, back up the database, and delete user and their reactions.

Here are some of the key third-party libraries powering this application.

## Libraries

- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces without writing custom CSS.
- **Auth0** - A flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to applications.
- **Flask** - A lightweight web framework for Python, ideal for creating small to medium web applications.
- **python-dotenv** - Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, making it easier to manage configuration settings.
- **authlib** - Comprehensive authentication library for Python, supports OAuth1, OAuth2, and more.
- **requests** - Python's go-to HTTP client library, used for making various HTTP requests.
- **Flask-Cors** - A Flask extension to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and allow web browsers to make requests across domains.
- **SQLAlchemy** - A powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** - Combines Flask with SQLAlchemy, adding useful defaults and helpers to simplify database operations in Flask applications.
- **pylint** - A static code analysis tool for Python, used to identify coding errors and enforce a coding standard.
- **pytest** - A testing framework for Python, making it easier to write simple and scalable test cases.
- **coverage** - A tool for measuring code coverage in Python, providing insights into which parts of a codebase are covered by tests. It helps ensure that all critical paths are tested, increasing code reliability.
- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, Gunicorn acts as an interface between Python web applications and the web server, known for its efficiency and ability to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Nginx**: A high-performance web server, Nginx excels in serving static content, reverse proxying, and load balancing, commonly used in front of Python applications to manage HTTP requests and static files.
- **Supervisor**: A process control system for UNIX-like operating systems, Supervisor monitors and controls processes like Gunicorn, ensuring they are consistently running and restarting them if necessary.

**
The current production version of the application is running on Linode. For development, it should be tested on a local server of your local machine. For production, this project requires setting up Ubuntu 22.04, python3, pip, gunicorn, nginx, etc. Instructions are given below to set up the project for development.
An Auth0 account is required to setup the project my secret key for auth0 is provided in the enivornment variables. But to try a different project key with your provided environment from Auth0. Here is the link below and follow the instructions.
